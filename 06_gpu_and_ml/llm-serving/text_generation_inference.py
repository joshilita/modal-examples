# # Hosting any LLaMA 2 model with Text Generation Inference (TGI)
#
# In this example, we show how to run an optimized inference server using [Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)
# with performance advantages over standard text generation pipelines including:
# - continuous batching, so multiple generations can take place at the same time on a single container
# - PagedAttention, which applies memory paging to the attention mechanism's key-value cache, increasing throughput
#
# This example deployment, [accessible here](https://modal-labs--tgi-app.modal.run), can serve LLaMA 2 70B with
# 70 second cold starts, up to 200 tokens/s of throughput, and a per-token latency of 55ms.

# ## Setup
#
# First we import the components we need from `modal`.

import os
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path

from modal import Image, Mount, Secret, Stub, asgi_app, enter, exit, gpu, method

# Next, we set which model to serve, taking care to specify the GPU configuration required
# to fit the model into VRAM, and the quantization method (`bitsandbytes` or `gptq`) if desired.
# Note that quantization does degrade token generation performance significantly.
#
# Any model supported by TGI can be chosen here.

MODEL_ID = "georgesung/llama2_7b_chat_uncensored"
REVISION = "abef8a13940181307bd8343699e80018b4b41528"
# Add `["--quantize", "gptq"]` for TheBloke GPTQ models.

# ## Define a container image
#
# We want to create a Modal image which has the Huggingface model cache pre-populated.
# The benefit of this is that the container no longer has to re-download the model from Huggingface -
# instead, it will take advantage of Modal's internal filesystem for faster cold starts. On
# the largest 70B model, the 135GB model can be loaded in as little as 70 seconds.
#
# ### Download the weights
# We can use the included utilities to download the model weights (and convert to safetensors, if necessary)
# as part of the image build.
#


def download_model():
    subprocess.run(
        [
            "text-generation-server",
            "download-weights",
            MODEL_ID,
            "--revision",
            REVISION,
        ],
        env={
            **os.environ,
            "HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN": os.environ["HF_TOKEN"],
        },
        check=True,
    )


# ### Image definition
# Weâ€™ll start from a Docker Hub image recommended by TGI, and override the default `ENTRYPOINT` for
# Modal to run its own which enables seamless serverless deployments.
#
# Next we run the download step to pre-populate the image with our model weights.
#
# For this step to work on a [gated model](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference#using-a-private-or-gated-model)
# such as LLaMA 2, the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable must be set.
#
# After [creating a HuggingFace access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
# and accepting the [LLaMA 2 license](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf),
# head to the [secrets page](https://modal.com/secrets) to share it with Modal
#
# Finally, we install the `text-generation` client to interface with TGI's Rust webserver over `localhost`.

# ## The model class
#
# The inference function is best represented with Modal's [class syntax](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions).
# The class syntax is a special representation for a Modal function which splits logic into two parts:
# 1. the `@enter()` function, which runs once per container when it starts up, and
# 2. the `@method()` function, which runs per inference request.
#
# This means the model is loaded into the GPUs, and the backend for TGI is launched just once when each
# container starts, and this state is cached for each subsequent invocation of the function.
# Note that on start-up, we must wait for the Rust webserver to accept connections before considering the
# container ready.
#
# Here, we also
# - specify the secret so the `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable can be set
# - specify how many A100s we need per container
# - specify that each container is allowed to handle up to 10 inputs (i.e. requests) simultaneously
# - keep idle containers for 10 minutes before spinning down
# - increase the timeout limit
